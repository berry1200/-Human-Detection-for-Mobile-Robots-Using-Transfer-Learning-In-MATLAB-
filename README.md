# -Human-Detection-for-Mobile-Robots-Using-Transfer-Learning-In-MATLAB-
This project implements a simple **human vs nonhuman image classifier** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning** in MATLAB.  It is designed for mobile robots or camera systems that only need to know: > “Is there a human in this image or not?”
